# ToDo App built using ReactJs
ToDo is a minimal app created using Reactjs framework.

## Get source code
'''bash
Go to Releases and Download the .zip file
'''

I used gh-pages to publish my code to github pages and make it accessible for everyone to use it.

Check the app : https://iamtanmaypandey.github.io/todo-react-app/


Thankyou !
